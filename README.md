# Numerical-Analysis
Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis. Various field of sub disciplines are applied in solving the problems. Some of the major ones are Root Finding, Function Optimization, Approximation and Interpolation and Fitting.
